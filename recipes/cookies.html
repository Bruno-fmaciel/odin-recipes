    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butterly cookies for you to that day you need sugar in 
        your veins or make your family, girlfriend and friends day!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>120g of brown sugar</li>
        <li>90g of white sugar</li>
        <li>140g of butter</li>
        <li>40g of noisette butter</li>
        <li>1 big egg</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon of bicarbonate</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of yeast</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>250g of wheat flour</li>
        <li>Vanilla essemce, salt to taste</li>
        <li>180g of chocolate</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the burnt butter or noisette</li>
        <li>In a small pan, heat 40 grams of butter over medium
             heat until golden. Transfer to a bowl and place in the fridge for 10 minutes to lower the temperature. Reserve.</li>
        <li>You can replace noisette butter with normal butter, but we recommend noisette,
             which adds a sweetness that intensifies and complexifies the flavors.</li>
        <li>Place the remaining butter (140 grams) at room temperature in a large bowl and, using a spatula, mix and knead until it forms an ointment. 
            Add the sugar and noisette butter and beat with a mixer or a whisk until creamy. Add the egg and vanilla and mix well. Reserve.</li>
        <li>Sift the flour with the salt and baking powder and chop the chocolate. The chocolate should be chopped unevenly so that there are 
            larger and smaller pieces inside the cookies after baking.</li>
        <li>Gently incorporate the sifted flour with a spatula, alternating with the chopped chocolate.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into a ball (approximately the size of a small scoop of ice cream), transfer to a baking tray lined with baking paper, 
            leaving space between them, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. It is important that the dough only goes into the fridge after it has been shaped.
            Tip: The dough balls can stay in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or 1 month in the freezer before baking.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 180 ÂºC for 12 to 15 minutes. The center of the cookie should still be soft when removed from the oven.</li>
        <li>Let cool down before eating.</li>
    </ol>
